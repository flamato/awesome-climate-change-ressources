# 📈 Data and Metrics that can help fix the Climate Change

🔥🌏 This is a curated list of data visualizations and metrics related to climate change - hoping to give insight into the matter!

**Climate change is the biggest threat of our generation.** Emissions are rising and according to the newest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/), we are heading towards an [unprecedented disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html).
[Political outrage](https://rebellion.earth/) is slowly forming but we also need *technological disruptions*! This living list aims to *educate* hackers and developers on promising tech projects against climate change, *hoping to inspire immediate and disruptive technological climate action!*
