# 📈 Data and Metrics that can help fix the Climate Change

🔥🌏 This is a curated list of data visualizations and metrics related to climate change - hoping to give insight into the matter!

**Climate change is the biggest threat of our generation.** Emissions are rising and according to the newest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/), we are heading towards an [unprecedented disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html).
[Political outrage](https://rebellion.earth/) is slowly forming but we also need *technological disruptions*! This living list aims to *educate* hackers and developers on promising tech projects against climate change, *hoping to inspire immediate and disruptive technological climate action!*

## 🌍 Climate Change and Society
- [Global Carbon Atlas](http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org) is a platform to explore and visualize the most up-to-date data on carbon fluxes resulting from human activities and natural processes.
- [Climate Impact Lab](http://www.impactlab.org/) is a collaboration of 30 climate scientists, economists, computational experts, researchers, analysts, and students from the US providing insights into climate change.
- [The Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org) manages best practice standards for climate and sustainable development interventions to maximise impact.
- [Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions) maps out causes and 100 solutions to global warming. The structure of this list is inspired by Project Drawdown. [[TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/chad_frischmann_100_solutions_to_climate_change#t-1009931)]
